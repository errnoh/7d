Seven Days (7d) is a simple calendar software.

Main point is that quite often I find myself being only interested in the stuff that is 
happening during the next seven days.
I also tend to have weekly entries and I dislike complex syntax or having to click through
pile of menus before I can add simple entry.

7d reads a simple plaintext file that has calendar entries formatted in simple syntax:
        each|every <weekday> <description>
    or
        <date> <description>

Everything else is discarded so you can store whatever else you want in the same file.

<date> can be formatted in three ways:
    25.3.2012
    2012-03-25
    25.3    <- Uses the _current_ year.

One thing to note: If current day is Wednesday for example,
the displayed Monday and Tuesday will be the _next_ weeks, not the previous days.
You will never see past dates. (Unless you offset the week that is)
